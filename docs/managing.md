In the Lodge dashboard, we have built in monitoring tools to manage Kafka and Zookeeper.

Kafka Kowl is a management tool that will allow the user to see a list of all the topics dynamically generated by filebeat when it ships logs to Kafka. Within the consumer group tab, we can see that logstash belongs to a consumer group that is consuming logs from Kafka topics and in the brokers tab we can see all the kafka brokers.

Heading over to ZooNavigator, itâ€™s a management tool that allows us to manage both kafka and zookeeper in one place. If we zoom into kafka, we have access to all things kafka, for example, list of kafka brokers, consumers, config, etc.
