This is what Lodge looks like from a userâ€™s perspective on a high level. The user has deployed Lodge on their network, so now all the applications in that network can ship logs to the stack using Filebeat, a subset of Beats specifically for collecting and forwarding log data. The user can then view those logs from the Lodge dashboard that is deployed with the stack.
